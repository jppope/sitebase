#Site Base

Site Base is a laravel installation with a backend that will allow you to edit your content from the backend.
The idea is that you can write a web app but let people take care of the basic content without needing a developer.
Its also great for those "static sites", where you don't want to touch content, or for sites that don't need all that wordpress bulk.

#Features
*   TinyMCE for text editing
*   Foundation as a css framework


#Note: SiteBase is not recommended for anyone, in the same way that you shouldn't drink in high school...
I promise that there will be unintended consequences, but its probably better to use this than hard drugs (joomla)

hit me up anytime about anything that can make this better.
cheers!
